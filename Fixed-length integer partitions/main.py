A generalization of BÃ©zier surfaces, called the S-patch, uses an interesting scheme for indexing its control points.
In the case of an n-sided surface of degree d, each index has n non-negative integers that sum to d, and all possible configurations are used.
For example, for a 3-sided quadratic (degree 2) surface the control points are:
indices 3 2 => [[0,0,2],[0,1,1],[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[2,0,0]]
Given the degree and the number of sides, generate all control point indices. The order of the indices in the list can be arbitrary, so for the above example
[[1,1,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,2],[0,2,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
is also a good solution.
